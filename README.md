**`Frontend Developer`**

I have always had a strong interest in technology, which has driven me to explore and experiment with various projects over the past three years. During this time, I have honed my problem-solving skills by helping friends and family with diverse tech solutions, from troubleshooting software to creating small, tailored applications.
